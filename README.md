# GLCM-Project
This project aims to explore and implement texture analysis in digital images using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) technique. Texture is an important feature in image processing and computer vision, especially for recognizing objects, classifying regions, and segmenting images based on surface patterns. 

The main goal of this project is to extract meaningful texture features such as contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, and entropy using GLCM, which can be used for various applications including image classification, object recognition, and medical image analysis.

The project involves the following key steps:

Preprocessing: Converting input images to grayscale and normalizing them.

GLCM Computation: Generating co-occurrence matrices at different angles (0째, 45째, 90째, 135째) and distances.

Feature Extraction: Calculating statistical texture features from GLCM.

Analysis and Visualization: Comparing feature values across different textures and visualizing the results for interpretation.

Application: (Optional) Implementing a simple texture classification or segmentation task using the extracted features.
