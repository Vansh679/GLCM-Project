# GLCM-Project
This project aims to explore and implement texture analysis in digital images using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) technique. Texture is an important feature in image processing and computer vision, especially for recognizing objects, classifying regions, and segmenting images based on surface patterns.
